        <h3>Here's a timeline of Dennis Ritchie's life:</h3>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1941</span> - born in Bronxville, New York, U.S.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1963</span> - earned a bachelor's degree in physics
          Harvard University.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1967</span> - joined Bell Labs, where he first
          worked on the Multics operating system. Multics was a time-sharing
          system funded bt the Advanced Research Projects Agency
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold"
            >1968 - defended his Phd thesis on "Computational Complexity and
            Program Structure" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C.
            Fisher. Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree as he did
            not submit a bound copy of his dissertation to the Harvard Library,
            a requirement for the degree.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1969</span> - AT&T Corporation, then the parent
          company of Bell Labs withdrew from the Multics project and removed its
          GE computers. Upon the removal of the GE machines, Ritchie and
          Thompson developed a more flexible operating system for Bell Lab's
          obsolete PDP-7 minicomputer. Within a few months they had Created
          UNIX. A new operating system not tied to any particular hardware.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1970</span> - in conjunction with the development
          of UNIX, Ritchie contributed somewhat to Thompson's creation of the B
          programming language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1971</span> - as they moved their operating system
          to the newer PDP-11 minicomputer, the shortcomings in the B
          programming language became apparent. This led to the extending the
          language over the next year to create the C programming language. C
          and it's family of languages, including C++ and Java, remain among the
          most widely used computer programming languages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1973</span> - along with Thompson rewrote UNIX in
          C.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1983</span> - was named a fellow by Bell Labs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1988</span> - elected to the U.S. National Academy
          of Engineering
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1990</span> - appointed head of the System Software
          Research Department at Bell Labs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1995</span> - led the development of the Plan 9 and
          Inferno operating system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1998</span> - awarded the U.S. National Medal of
          Technology along with Thompson for the development of the UNIX
          operating system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">2007</span> - retires as head of System Software
          Research Department
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">2011</span> - dies at the age of 70 in Berkeley
