        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1941</span> - Born in Bronxville, New York, U.S.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1963</span> - Earned a bachelor's degree in
            physics Harvard University.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1967</span> - Joined Bell Labs, where he first
            worked on the Multics operating system. Multics was a time-sharing
            system funded bt the Advanced Research Projects Agency
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1968</span> - Defended his Phd thesis on
            "Computational Complexity and Program Structure" at Harvard under
            the supervision of Patrick C. Fisher. Ritchie never officially
            received his PhD degree as he did not submit a bound copy of his
            dissertation to the Harvard Library, a requirement for the degree.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1969</span> - AT&T Corporation, then the parent
            company of Bell Labs withdrew from the Multics project and removed
            its GE computers. Upon the removal of the GE machines, Ritchie and
            Thompson developed a more flexible operating system for Bell Lab's
            obsolete PDP-7 minicomputer. Within a few months they had Created
            UNIX. A new operating system not tied to any particular hardware.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1970</span> - In conjunction with the development
            of UNIX, Ritchie contributed somewhat to Thompson's creation of the
            B programming language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1971</span> - As they moved their operating
            system to the newer PDP-11 minicomputer, the shortcomings in the B
            programming language became apparent. This led to the extending the
            language over the next year to create the C programming language. C
            and it's family of languages, including C++ and Java, remain among
            the most widely used computer programming languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1973</span> - Along with Thompson rewrote UNIX in
            C.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1983</span> - Was named a fellow by Bell Labs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1988</span> - Elected to the U.S. National
            Academy of Engineering
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1990</span> - Appointed head of the System
            Software Research Department at Bell Labs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1995</span> - Led the development of the Plan 9
            and Inferno operating system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1998</span> - Awarded the U.S. National Medal of
            Technology along with Thompson for the development of the UNIX
            operating system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">2007</span> - Retires as head of System Software
            Research Department
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">2011</span> - Dies at the age of 70 in Berkeley
